Comments: I enjoyed this assignment as well. I am finally getting the hang of LinkedLists!
 I thought that the tests were a little more confusing this time because each test
uses several different methods so it was hard to get the project off the ground at first. But, once I had figured out the main
methods that were used most frequently in the tests I was able to figure it out!
I was surprised by how long my remove during iteration method was, maybe it could have been more concise, but it works!
